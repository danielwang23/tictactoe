# Tictactoe Project

Fully functional game of tic tac toe with an option to play against a computer, a friend, and keep track of scores.

*Currently WORKING on expanding the game to implement larger grid size, training the computer with AI/ML algorithms, and changing the UI/UX w/ the assistance of either Django or TKINTER GUI framework*
